Your donation directly supports the continued development of Qubes OS. We accept monetary donations in the following ways:

## Option 1: Give a one-time donation

With credit card donations, [we lose roughly 14%](https://documentation.opencollective.com/why-open-collective/pricing) to administrative costs, while donating cryptocurrency avoids these costs.

## FAQs on donating

Frequently asked questions about Qubes donations.
Join the conversation on our [mailing lists and forum](/support/).

### Why should I donate?

Qubes OS is free and open-source software.
This means we do not earn any revenue by selling it.
Instead, we rely on your financial support.
If you rely on Qubes for secure computing in your work or personal life or see the value in our efforts, then please donate.

Qubes OS is one of the few operating systems that places the security of its users above all else.
[Here is what others have to say about the project.](/endorsements/)
A project like this requires a wide spectrum of expertise.
In order to both retain and expand our core team, we deeply appreciate donations from supporters like you.

With the help of our community, we hope to eventually build a nonprofit organization that will ensure the long-term future of the Qubes Project.

### How is my donation used?

Your donation keeps the Qubes OS Project going, paying primarily for the open-source developers who build Qubes OS itself, as well as secondary expenses, such as infrastructure, needed to support their work and our community.

### Do donors get personalized support or special feature requests?

We regret that we cannot provide personalized support to donors or implement specific features based on donations.
In both cases, the reason is that our resources are limited.
If we were to allocate these limited resources to providing support to individual donors and implemented their requested features, we wouldn't have enough resources left over to make timely progress on our core projects, and the long-term sustainability of Qubes would suffer.

### Is my donation tax deductible?

Donations via credit card or cryptocurrency to the Qubes OS Project are not tax deductible.
Donations via [EU Bank Transfer](#how-can-i-donate-via-eu-bank-transfer) should be tax deductible.

### How can I donate via EU bank transfer?

We have partnered with the [Center for the Cultivation of Technology](https://techcultivation.org) (CCT) to handle EU bank transfers.
CCT is a charitable non-profit host organization in Germany for international Free Software projects.
They charge a 10% fee for this service.

Please send your donation to the following German bank account, ensuring you write the correct **purpose of transfer**:

```
Account holder: Center for the Cultivation of Technology gGmbH
IBAN: DE65 4306 0967 4111 9411 01
BIC: GENODEM1GLS
Purpose of transfer: QUBES-F6PLUR4N
Bank: GLS Gemeinschaftsbank eG
Bank address: Christstrasse 9, 44789, Bochum, Germany
```

Donations should be tax-deductible to the full extent permitted by law across all member countries of the European Union (EU).
With almost 30 EU member states, no guarantees can be given for all tax authorities.
However CCT, has had no known issues with the recognition of tax-deductible donation status at the time of writing.

CCT is happy to provide individual donation receipts and work with you on their recognition.
For that, please send your full name and postal address and the date of your transaction to `donate@techcultivation.org`.

### Can I donate something other than money?

We prefer monetary contributions which allow us greater flexibility.
However, if you or your organization has relevant knowledge, experience, leads, or resources and would like to help us secure the future of Qubes OS, donâ€™t hesitate to [contact us](mailto:funding@qubes-os.org).

### How do I verify your Bitcoin address?

- [HELLOTUX](https://www.hellotux.com/qubesos)
- [CypherMarket](https://cyphermarket.com/product-tag/qubes/)

Please note that some of these are unofficial initiatives started by Qubes OS users.
The Qubes OS Project is not responsible for the type, quality, price, appearance, shipping, or any other aspect of the merchandise being sold by these third-party organizations.
We are grateful for any donations to the Qubes OS Project from merchandise sales, but please note that we generally have no way of verifying the accounting details regarding merchandise sales.
Likewise, we are generally unable to vet the organizations or individuals who have undertaken these initiatives.
In some cases, the Qubes OS Project is simply informed after-the-fact that such merchandise has been made available.

### What is Qubes?

Qubes OS is a free and open source operating system that focuses on security and privacy.
Its architecture is built to enable you to define and visualize different security environments on your computer and control how they interact, helping you to get your work done safely.
