title: Qubes security bulletins (QSBs)
---

A **Qubes security bulletin (QSB)** is a security announcement issued by the
[Qubes security team](https://doc.qubes-os.org/en/latest/project-security/security.html#qubes-security-team) through the [Qubes
security pack](/security/pack/). A QSB typically provides a summary and impact
analysis of one or more recently-discovered software vulnerabilities, including
details about patching to address them. For Xen security advisories (XSAs), see
the [XSA tracker](/security/xsa/).
